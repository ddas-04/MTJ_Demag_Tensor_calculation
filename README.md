This repository contains the code for calculating the demagnetization factors of the MTJ. 

The formulation is taken from Osborn, John A. "Demagnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid." Physical review 67.11-12 (1945): 351. (https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.67.351).

The results were verified with Table I and II given in the paper.
